Fluent API is an advanced way of specifying model configuration that covers everything that data annotation
can do in addition to some advanced configuration which are not possible with data annotation.

Like we have to define composite key on the foreign keys that we saw in the last video.

Data, annotations and fluent API can be used together, but code first will give preference to fluent
API, then data annotation and finally default convention.

So fluent API is just another way to configure your domain classes.

In order to use fluent API, you have to do that in the Dbcontext class with the on model creating override.
